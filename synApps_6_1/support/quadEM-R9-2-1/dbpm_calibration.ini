'You can have as many ranges (up to 8) for each Cal Name

' Slope and offset will be interpolated in between listed ranges, when possible.
'At least one range must be listed. 

' For each named type, list the slope, offset correction for channels A-D
' The offset is SUBTRACTED  and then result DIVIDED by the slope. 
' Corrected_Data = (nA - offset) / Slope

' EXAMPLE:
' [direct_range1]
